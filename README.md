# isaklar-ai

Regrettably, this ai is a neural-network trained using reinforcement learning. I used Keras, which is a library in tensorflow that makes machine learning *slightly* easier.

To run: just drag the "ai" folder into any version of [oskhen-ahanifi-game](https://github.com/INDAPlus20/oskhen-ahanifi-game) and specify the "super_duper_ai.py" script in their config file.

Tensorflow doesnt work with Python 3.9.x, so you will have to use 3.8.x or older. Before you run it, you will also have to install the required libraries specified in `ai/requirements.txt`, which is easily done with `pip install -r ai/requirements.txt`.

To train the model i used a modified version of [oskhen-ahanifi-game](https://github.com/INDAPlus20/oskhen-ahanifi-game), which i have provided, so if you want to try the train.py script, make sure to use it in the provided version of this repo.
